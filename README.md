# Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis of Apps Reviews

This is a replication package of the paper: **An Automated Approach to Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) of Apps Reviews Using Machine and Deep Learning**

In this paper,  we built ABSA models using supervised Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) approaches.  
Our automated technique is intended to (1) identify the most useful and effective text-representation and task-specific features in both Aspect Category Detection (ACD) and Aspect Category Polarity (ACP), (2)  empirically investigate the performance of conventional ML models when utilized for ABSA task of apps reviews, and (3) empirically compare  the performance of ML models and DL models in the context of ABSA task.

The dataset used in this work is called **AWARE**: **A**BSA **W**arehouse of **A**pps **RE**views, and can be accessed through [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/5528481)
